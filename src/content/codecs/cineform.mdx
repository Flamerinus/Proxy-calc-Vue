**GoPro CineForm** is a high-quality video codec developed by CineForm, Inc., which was acquired by GoPro in 2011. The codec is widely used in professional video production due to its efficiency and ability to maintain high image quality. Here are some key points about the GoPro CineForm codec:

### Key Features

1. **High Quality Compression**:
   - CineForm provides visually lossless compression, meaning it reduces file sizes significantly while preserving the original image quality to a degree that is almost indistinguishable to the human eye.

2. **Multi-Resolution Support**:
   - The codec supports a wide range of resolutions, from standard definition (SD) to high definition (HD), 2K, 4K, and even higher resolutions. This makes it suitable for various types of video production, including digital cinema.

3. **10-bit and 12-bit Color Depth**:
   - CineForm supports 10-bit and 12-bit color depths, allowing for greater color precision and detail. This is particularly beneficial for color grading and post-production work.

4. **Alpha Channel Support**:
   - The codec supports alpha channels, which is useful for compositing and visual effects work where transparency information is needed.

5. **Real-Time Editing**:
   - One of CineForm's strengths is its ability to support real-time editing and playback, even with high-resolution footage. This reduces the need for rendering and proxies, speeding up the editing workflow.

6. **Wavelet Compression**:
   - CineForm uses wavelet compression, which is different from the more common DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform) used in codecs like H.264. Wavelet compression offers better quality at higher compression ratios and is more resilient to generation loss.

Profiles
***
**CineForm** offers several profiles to cater to different quality and performance needs:

- **Filmscan 1 and 2**: Designed for the highest quality archival purposes, with Filmscan 2 being virtually lossless.
- **High**: Intended for high-quality production work, providing excellent balance between quality and file size.
- **Medium**: Suitable for general post-production use, offering good quality at a lower file size.
- **Low**: Used for lower-quality needs where file size is a significant concern.

### Use Cases

1. **Post-Production**:
   - CineForm is widely used in post-production for editing, color correction, and effects work. Its high-quality compression and support for high bit-depths make it ideal for professional editing environments.

2. **Archiving**:
   - The codecâs ability to maintain high quality at reduced file sizes makes it suitable for archiving valuable footage.

3. **Virtual Reality (VR)**:
   - GoPro has utilized CineForm in its VR efforts, particularly because of its ability to handle high resolutions and its efficient compression.

### Integration

- **Software Support**: CineForm is supported by major video editing software, including Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, DaVinci Resolve, and Avid Media Composer.
- **GoPro Products**: Naturally, it is integrated into GoProâs ecosystem, including their cameras and software like GoPro Studio.

### Conclusion

The GoPro CineForm codec is a robust and versatile codec designed for professional video production. Its high-quality compression, multi-resolution support, and efficient real-time performance make it a valuable tool in both post-production and archiving. Its widespread adoption and support in major editing platforms further enhance its utility in the industry.

*GoPro Cineform is a variable bit rate codec, and as such, there are no official data rates.\
For the purpose of getting a rough idea of the file size you can achieve with this codec, I encoded
a sample file from Arri's 
<a href = "https://www.arri.com/en/learn-help/learn-help-camera-system/camera-sample-footage-reference-image" class="link" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">official website</a> 
with all the Cineform variants available, namely the file called A007C002_151124_R3VJ.mov from the Arri AMIRA ProRes <a href = "https://f.io/SNEXr27k" class="link" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a> on that page, in the Prores_4KUHD.zip file.\
<a href = "https://github.com/Flamerinus/Proxycalc/blob/main/A007C002_151124_R3VJ_24p_HD_H265.mov" class="link" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">Here</a> is a 720p compressed version of the video, so you can appreciate the amount of movement in the footage.\
The encoding was done with <a href = "https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/es/products/davinciresolve" class="link" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">Davinci Resolve</a> 18.6 in Windows 10. \
It shows the bit rate you can expect from such a file, with this amount of movement and color.\
In a talking head video, the bit rate should drop roughly a 5-10% and for more dynamic footage it could grow by 5-10%,
but this is the approximate size you're expected to get from the codec at these resolutions and frame rates.
So if knowing the file size is mission critical, take these numbers with a grain of salt and do your own testing :D\
Resolve's naming strategy might lead to confusion, because Cineform RGB 16 Bits, as they call it, is really a 12 bit codec, and only the alpha channel can be encoded with 16 bits, just like ProRes4444.\
I call it RGB 12 in this section, for more clarity. No alpha channels were encoded in any of the files.*
